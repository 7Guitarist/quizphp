              The PHP Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) is a programming language
              that allows web developers to create dynamic content that
              interacts with databases. PHP is basically used for developing web
              based software applications. This tutorial helps you to build your
              base with PHP.

              PHP started out as a small open source project that evolved as
              more and more people found out how useful it was. Rasmus Lerdorf

              operator. PHP language supports following type of operators.

              An array is a data structure that stores one or more similar type
              of values in a single value. For example if you want to store 100
              numbers then instead of defining 100 variables its easy to define
              an array of 100 length.

              There are three different kind of arrays and each array value is

              A constant is a name or an identifier for a simple value. A
              constant value cannot change during the execution of the script.
              By default, a constant is case-sensitive. By convention, constant
              identifiers are always uppercase. A constant name starts with a
              letter or underscore, followed by any number of letters, numbers,
              or underscores. If you have defined a constant, it can never be
              changed or undefined.
            </p>
            <p class="wiki-text">
              To define a constant you have to use define() function and to
              retrieve the value of a constant, you have to simply specifying
              its name. Unlike with variables, you do not need to have a
              constant with a $. You can also use the function constant() to
              read a constant's value if you wish to obtain the constant's name
              dynamically.

              As indicated by the name, this function will return the value of
              the constant.

            <p class="wiki-text">
              This is useful when you want to retrieve value of a constant, but
              you do not know its name, i.e. It is stored in a variable or
              returned by a function.

              <li>
                Constants cannot be defined by simple assignment, they may only
